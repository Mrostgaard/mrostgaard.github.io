<br/>
<i>For a smaller introduction to me and a look at contact details, please see the <a href="/">frontpage.</a></i>

<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Mark, I'm 27 years old, I live in Copenhagen and works as a software developer.</p>
<p>I have experience with quite a few different programming paradigms and languages. My primary tools for development is Python and React.</p>

<p>I also have a few years experience with Blockchain technology. I've written my masters about Ethereum<sup>[<a target="_blank" href="/files/Thesis.pdf">link</a>]</sup>, I've worked over a year for Bitcoin Suisse and I've cofounded, and also volunteered in, Nordic Blockchain Association.
    I've also had some speaking about Bitcoin and blockchain technology, more details can be found <a href="#speaking">here.</a></p>

<p>I've worked as a consultant, where I've implemented different software solutions, amongst these are some bank compliance software for Googles technology stack.</p>

<h1>Experience and what i'm offering</h1>
<p>I have a understanding that most people, will not know, or care of, technical details of my expertise. For this reason the details can be found the <a href="#details">headline below.</a> </p>

<p>I offer a variaty of services. Mostly i like to create things and working with new technologies, so if you have a project you might think I can help with, don't hesistate to contact me and we can have a non-committal conversation.</p>

<p>I have extensive experience in building backend and frontend software. One of my greatest enjoyment is to create beautifull frontends, that is user engaging and friendly to use. </p>
<p>I can setup and work with the most common database system and I have experience working with servers, mostly Linux based. If you want your system to run on AWS services it is also something i have some experience with.</p>
<p>I can talk about Blockchain technology for days, so if you have an interest in this or would like me to talk at a conference, or maybe your collegues, about blockchain, what it is and if this is something that's right for your company, I can help with that </p>

<h2 id="details">Technical details</h2>
<p>I have years of experience working full stack, juggling between a beautifull and easy to use frontend, and a powerfull backend.</p>

<p>Most of my backend experience is either in Python with Django or C# with the Entity Framework.</p>
<h4 id="gdc">For Python some of the projects I've worked on includes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>An Investment portfolio tracker</li>
    <li>A Google Drive compliance tool</li>
    <li>Web Portal to manage security</li>
</ul>
I've also created the frontends for these projects in React.

<h4>Some of the C# projects I've worked on includes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A Crypto Payment system</li>
    <li>An abstraction layer for easy communication with multiple blockchains</li>
</ul>

<h4>Blockchain</h4>

<p>I have a great interest and expertise with Blockchain Technology. Ranging from a high theoretical understanding of the technical components, all the to the financial incentives and game theory.</p>
<p>Other than the projects I've worked on as a part of my employment at Bitcoin Suisse, I've also done some academic work in that capacity:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build a Bitcoin like blockchain in Python</li>
    <li>Researched how to use Blockchain to decentralize Certificate Authorities<sup>[<a target="_blank" href="/files/Thesis.pdf">link</a>]</sup></li>
